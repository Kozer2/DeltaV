# My top 3 things I learned from the **How Computer Work** Series

1. While I already knew them, watching the visual representation of AND, OR, NOT, etc was a fun way to get refreshed on them. I have not thought or used them in *awhile*.
2. Seeing the 1s and 0s draw letters in the CPU, Memory, Input, and Output video was new to me. I had never thought about how the monitor screens know what goes where and seeing the tiny RGB's up close was pretty cool. 
3. It was amazing to learn about how the CPU takes commands from software in the hardware and Software video. I was really shocked at what they can do considering how many tasks the CPU juggles at one time. 

## Things I think you should know
1. Some of the most basic logic behind programming are commands such as ```AND```, ```OR```, ```NOT```. An ```AND``` command needs both inputs to be the same or they are both false. ```OR``` just needs 1 command to be the right one, and ```NOT``` needs both to *not* be the set value. 
2. Everything a computer does is based on input and output. No matter how complex a task may be in the end it is two simple things. 
3. Hardware makes it possible for your computer to do what you tell it to do. Even the simplest command you can give it, might be far more advanced than commands given decades ago. And your computer takes that command and converts it into the simplest language possible for the CPU to run the task. Binary 1s and 0s
