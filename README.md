## Every day is a fresh beginning

Growth mindset to me, ~~means that when the going gets tough I get going~~ is never backing down from a challenge or something new. Its seeking out and continuing to grow and to further educate yourself. It means that we are not fixed at a certain level of competence but that we can grow out of who we are and become something else. 
- **I will always seek to better myself**
-  *Each day is a new chance to change who I am and to become something more* 
- ***Never settle for whats comfortable***
