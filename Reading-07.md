### Things to know from Into + Scripts
* Using JS you can set it so that only parts of pages reload when certain actions are triggered. This saves time of a full reload and makes the pages appear faster
* Scripts are instructions given to the computer to perform. Scripts are specific and perform limited actions but many together can do more. 
* Instructions to a computer need to be specific. A computer will **only** do what the instructions say and no more. 

### Things to know from Expressions
* An expression is something that relies on an operator to either assign a single value or use several values to return a single value. 
* Many types of operators such as: ```+``` adds, ```-``` subtracts, ```/``` divides, ```*``` multiplies, ```++``` adds one to the current number, ```--``` subtracts one from the current number, ```%``` gives you the remainder of dividing two values. 7%3 = 1. 
* Strings are things inside ```' '```. They have one operator and it is the plus sign. ```Hello``` + ```World``` = HelloWorld
* You can use this in JS to return greetings and send welcome messages to visitors in conjustion with scripts.

* Functions need several things to work
 * First you need to call the function
  * then you give it parameters
   * and then finally it returns you a value
