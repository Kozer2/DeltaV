#Reading for 2 Day 1


- The first thing you need to do is pick an editor that works best for what you need. Or one that you are most comfortable with. 
I use Text++, Brackets, and Atom but there are many others. These will allow you to do most of the same things with varying differing addons. 

- the next step you will need to do is become comfortable with the command line. For Windows users the default one can be accessed by taking "cmd" into the search bar at the bottom. A useful one that is used in many places is [Gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org/)  
  - Gitbash saves previous commends in it, if you need to use a recent command you've type hit the up arrow. 
  
 - Gitbash can be used to look at files. This can be done in the editor window and would look something like this *username*@bash: ls *foldername)
