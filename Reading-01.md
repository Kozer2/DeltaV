# Read 01 Learning Markdown 
Learning Markdown is easy.

First you may ask what is Markdown? 
Markdown is used to change the way webpages look. It allows you to change the type of texts on the web. From normal text to **bold** text *and* ***more!***

The above text contains exampls of bolding and italicizing text. You can combine them as you wish. 
You can also create headers or titles for your webpage. 


# This is the largest or H1
## This is slightly smaller known as H2. 
###### It goes all the way to H6. 
All you need to do to create headers is to use the pound sign(#)

You can use Markdown to create ordered or unordered lists. 
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

* First Item
* Second Item

You can create different types of links. https://kozer2.github.io/Learning-Journal/   this is an example of just pasting a url or you could [create](https://kozer2.github.io/Learning-Journal/) a link within a word using open and closed brackets. []

Some more advanced mMarkdowns lets you place code into the webpage keeping its syntax from you IDE. 
Here is an example in python
```python
def test():
    counter = 1
    while counter <= 10:
            print(counter)
            counter += 1
            
```

There is far more that you can do with Markdowns. This is only a small amount that can be accomplished with it. For more information for it click [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
