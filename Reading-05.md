## Chapter 10 Intro to CSS

**What did I learn?**
* You can style different boxes according to what you want
* You can change multiple varaiables to change each line by using a comma 
* You can link to an outside CSS sheet to configure the style of the page. Like using a seperate file in the same folder 
* Or use style tags inside the HTML doc


### Example CSS

```<!DOCTYPE html>```
```<html>```
    ```<head>```
    ```<style>```
    ```div.a{```
        ```font-size: 25pm;```
    ```}```
    ```</style>```
    ```</head>```
    ```</html>```
    
* CSS goes top down, with the last change taking affect over another one. If two lines try to change the same item, the later will will be what you see
