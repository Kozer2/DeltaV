## Reading 06a

This reading was **challenging** for me because my Ubuntu had my files hidden deep in my computer
But I did it. 

* I learned how to create a simple script in a Java.js file that I called in a .html file. 
* The script was variable depending on the time of day that it is access and varies its message according.

  * ```<script src="js/add-content.js"></script>``` this line of code called a file named *add-content* that is within a file called *js*

 Here is the webpage I [made](https://kozer2.github.io/Class06/add-content.html)
