### What is Git?


Git is a tool that assists in creating code and allows for local, centralized, and Distributed control of different versions of the same code file. 
### What does this mean?
Local control means that Git allows you to see the changes you make to a file you are working on. 

Centralized control means that Git allows teams to work on the same file, making changes as they go without interferring with others on the team. If mistakes happen Git allows you to go back to a previous *snapshot* or save of the file back when it was working. 

Distributed control means that Git uses multiple servers to store your files that you are working on. If one goes down, don't worry. You can keep working. 

### Key terms

*Snapshot*
* A snapshot basically means that when you change your file and commit the changes, Git saves an older version of the code from before you committed those changes. You can go back if you break what you are working on. 

*Tracking Changes*
* No matter how small the change you make is, Git saves and tracks that change. You can go back and see what you changed and why, assuming you wrote down what it is you did. 

*repository*
* A repository or a repo is a location where the code you work on is stored. 

Whats that? You want to get working with it? You can download Git!
- [Mac OS](http://git-scm.com/download/mac)

- [Windows OS](http://git-scm.com/download/win)

- [Linux OS](http://git-scm.com/download/linux)


Once you have Git ready to go, there is much you can do. You need to create a repo to house it. From there you can begin adding files and coding as you go. I recommend reading some starter [material](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/#6).
